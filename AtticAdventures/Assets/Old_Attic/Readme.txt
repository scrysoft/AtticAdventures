This package includes 3 different Render Pipelines.


The Default Render Pipiline for the Package is HDRP.
The other Pipilines are in the folders "URP" and "BuiltIn"

If you have downloaded this package and want to use the other Render Pipelines, please follow the instructions below:


Note: The package Scenes are only avaliable in the HDRP package.


1) Open the package in an HDRP project.

*If you get any import error, press Ignore to open the project (These errors are a result of the 3 pipilines, but they won't affect your work in any way)*

2) Open a NEW project in the Pipiline you want to use URP/BuiltIn

3) Copy the folder named "URP" from the package into the NEW URP project, or the "BuiltIn" folder if you are using a BuiltIn Project

4) After doing this the asset should all work just fine.
